            A saucy chicken and mushroom dish. Was served to me when i was a child and has become a common recipe on the weekly rotation.
            can be enjoyed with rice,bread or with your choice of carb. It is also a great dish by itself. Mother orginally found it in a recipe
            book for quick meals. since then it has changed to a family variations that changes from time to time.
